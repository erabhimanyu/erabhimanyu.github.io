      "content"	 : "I have been exposed to slackline (an act of walk-balancing on a flat webbing tensioned between two anchors), Thanks to Adarsh Tribal and India Fellow program. Since then, it has become my own tool for meditation and mindfulness. So many things I have realized about the self and mind while walking over the line(flat-webbing). I have learned that when you are walking on the line, the thin layer between the imagination and reality blurs. If you only think you cannot, you would fall. Even if you only think you can, you would fall. Only when you bring right kind of action with right kind of thought - then you walk.",
